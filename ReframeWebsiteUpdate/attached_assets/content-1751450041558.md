What our users say

## Testimonials

> “The COVID-19 Pandemic greatly impacted my life. I suddenly found myself being very anxious and I even developed Panic Attacks. During such a moment I called the EAP line. I received immediate support and I can honestly say it was the first time in many weeks I finally felt safe. The EAP linked me with a therapist and I am now in control of the situation.”

**Alya, 45**

Clerk, Dubai

> “I had many signals that our employees might benefit from mental health support, but I was concerned I would not be able to prove the worth of such programs to my senior leaders. After a trial period, CCS helped us in understanding the great ROI we have from our EAP, both at human level but also financially. The program has been running smoothly for over 6 years since.”

**Anna, 57**

HR Manager, Russia

> “My landlord was giving me lots of troubles and caused me a great deal of stress. Being an expat in a foreign country I was lost in understanding my rights as a tenant. My EAP’s legal consultant explained what I was entitled to and aided me in managing the situation based on Luxembourgish laws. It was great help!”
