- ## Participating in 'The Impossible Grief' training with Marie-Adele was truly a great experience. The insights gained and the tools learned have helped me navigate through challenging emotions and find strength in vulnerability. The trainer's guidance was not only informative but also deeply inspiring. I am grateful for this opportunity to grow and learn, and I highly recommend this training

- ## I’ve always been passionate about puppetry, but I never realized how deeply it involves self-discovery. This training introduced me to creative and modern approaches that delve into children's mindsets and imagination in powerful new ways. A heartfelt thank you to Reframe MHS and Karim Dakroub for this beautiful opportunity.
