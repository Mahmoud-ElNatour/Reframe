# Reframe Flask App

This project provides a minimal Flask implementation of the Reframe website. The original TypeScript/React code was replaced with Python templates and static files.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
